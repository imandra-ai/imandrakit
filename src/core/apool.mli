    This pool can be used for resources that are still reasonably
    cheap to produce and discard, and will never block waiting for
    a resource â€” it's not a good pool for DB connections.

    @param max_size maximum number of item in the pool before we start
      dropping resources on the floor. This controls resource consumption.
    @param clear a function called on items before recycling them.

(** [with_resource pool f] runs [f x] with [x] a resource;
