[![Build and Test](https://github.com/imandra-ai/imandrakit/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/imandra-ai/imandrakit/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is the core library used to build some of Imandra's projects.

It builds on top of [containers](https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/), [Moonpool](https://github.com/c-cube/moonpool/), as well as `mtime`, `ptime`, `logs`, `hmap`, `base64`, `uuidm`, and `ppx_deriving`.
